## Intro

Proving that code is correct is impractical. Testing does not guarantee correctness. However, good testing can minimize risk. This is all true in a single-threaded solution. As soon
as there are two or more threads using the same code and working with shared data, things
get substantially more complex.
Recommendation: Write tests that have the potential to expose problems and then
run them frequently, with different programatic configurations and system configurations
and load. If tests ever fail, track down the failure. Don’t ignore a failure just because the
tests pass on a subsequent run.
That is a whole lot to take into consideration. Here are a few more fine-grained
recommendations:
• Treat spurious failures as candidate threading issues.
• Get your nonthreaded code working first.
