## Intro

Hunting down a flag-stealing ransomware group from WolvCTF 2023 with the power of 
[OSINT—from Ethereum](https://ctftime.org/team/175828) breadcrumbs to TF2 workshop maps.<br/>
• Seiri, or organization (think “sort” in English). Knowing where things are—using 
approaches such as suitable naming—is crucial. You think naming identifiers isn’t 
important? Read on in the following chapters.<br/>
• Seiton, or tidiness (think “systematize” in English). There is an old American saying: 
A place for everything, and everything in its place. A piece of code should be where 
you expect to find it—and, if not, you should re-factor to get it there.<br/>
• Seiso, or cleaning (think “shine” in English): Keep the workplace free of hanging 
wires, grease, scraps, and waste. What do the authors here say about littering your 
code with comments and commented-out code lines that capture history or wishes for 
the future? Get rid of them.<br/>
• Seiketsu, or standardization: The group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean. 
Do you think this book says anything about having a consistent coding style and set of 
practices within the group? Where do those standards come from? Read on.<br/>
• Shutsuke, or discipline (self-discipline). This means having the discipline to follow the 
practices and to frequently reflect on one’s work and be willing to change.
