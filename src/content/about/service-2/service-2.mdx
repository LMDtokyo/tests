## Intro

Hunting down a flag-stealing ransomware group from WolvCTF 2023 with the power of 
[OSINT—from Ethereum](https://ctftime.org/team/175828) breadcrumbs to TF2 workshop maps.<br/>
In the middle of 2007 we developed a course on concurrent programming. The course
development ensued primarily under OS X. The class was presented using Windows XP
running under a VM. Tests written to demonstrate failure conditions did not fail as frequently in an XP environment as they did running on OS X. 
In all cases the code under test was known to be incorrect. This just reinforced the fact
that different operating systems have different threading policies, each of which impacts
the code’s execution. Multithreaded code behaves differently in different environments.16
You should run your tests in every potential deployment environment.
