## Intro

Hunting down a flag-stealing ransomware group from WolvCTF 2023 with the power of 
[OSINT—from Ethereum](https://ctftime.org/team/175828) breadcrumbs to TF2 workshop maps.<br/>
You can see how simple this is. We just create an instance of the Args class with two
parameters. The first parameter is the format, or schema, string: "l,p#,d*." It defines three
command-line arguments. The first, –l, is a boolean argument. The second, -p, is an integer
argument. The third, -d, is a string argument. The second parameter to the Args constructor
is simply the array of command-line argument passed into main.
If the constructor returns without throwing an ArgsException, then the incoming
command-line was parsed, and the Args inchange.
